# FIFA Player Classification Analysis

This project provides an analysis and classification of FIFA player data, focusing on player attributes across different positions. The goal is to categorize player positions and compare their performance across various skill areas like shooting, passing, defending, and more.

## Project Structure

The primary components of this project are:
1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing FIFA player data.
2. **Classification Model**: Building a machine learning model to classify players based on their attributes.
3. **Visualization**: Using various visualization techniques to analyze and compare attributes across player positions.

## Installation

To run this notebook, ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Install the required packages with the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the FIFA player dataset, clean and prepare it for analysis.
2. **Model Training**: The notebook includes code for training and evaluating a classification model to categorize player positions.
3. **Visualization**: Generate visual comparisons of player skills across different positions.

To run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook fifa_classification.ipynb
```



## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Convert specific player attributes for classification.
- Group players into general positions (e.g., Forward, Midfielder, Defender).

### Model Evaluation
- Train a classification model on the player attributes.
- Use accuracy scores and classification reports to assess model performance.

## Visualization

The notebook includes visualizations of player attributes and distributions across positions:
- **Bar Plot**: Distribution of players by position.
- **Box Plot**: Comparison of attributes (shooting, defending, etc.) across positions.
- **Radar Chart**: Average attribute values for each position.
- **Heatmap**: Mean attribute values for each position to illustrate strengths and weaknesses.

## Results

Key findings and model performance results, including accuracy scores and classification report metrics, are available in the notebook.
